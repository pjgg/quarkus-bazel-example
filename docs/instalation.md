# Installation

Bazel it's supported on many platforms, but we only have tested in two:

* Fedora/CentOS

```bash
dnf install dnf-plugins-core
dnf copr enable vbatts/bazel
dnf install bazel4
```

* macOS
```bash
brew install bazel
```

for other platform please check the [official documentation](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/install.html).
